      <h1>ATC Website</h1>
        As part of my Digital Technology class in Year 13, I created a client-driven website.
        We had to find our own clients, of which I sought out Mr Beveridge from Oamaru's Air Training Corps.
        Together we made a website to promote the Squadron that can be found <a href="https://26squadron.org.nz" class="top_panel_link">here</a>.

      <h2>What ATC is</h2>
      The Air Training Corps, or ATC, is a New Zealand youth organisation.
      ATC is part of a bigger military-styled group called the New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF).
      It is for teenagers of high school age.
      I was a member throughout high school so decided when searching for a client that I would ask Squadron Leader Derek if he would like a website made for the Oamaru squadron.
      The aim of the website was to promote the squadron and inform existing members of relevant news, as defined by Derek.

      <h2>Website process</h2>
      I started the website by hand-drawing basic layouts.
      I then had a meeting with my client, showed him the sketches and had a discussion on what the content and style of the website could be.
      Next I refined the sketches. After establishing the layout I researched fonts, colours, images, text and the site structure.
      Throughout the process I regularly communicated with my client to get his opinions. I also consulted primary and secondary stakeholders, recording and evaluating their feedback.
      After creating conceptual designs on paper and finalising the designs, I created high fidelity models on Photoshop.
      Lastly, I created the website using Dreamweaver.
      After the project was done, my client wished to keep the website so we arranged webhosting with HostPapa.
      We made the domain name <a href="https://26squadron.org.nz" class="body_link">26squadron.org.nz</a> because other squadrons across New Zealand had a similar URL.
