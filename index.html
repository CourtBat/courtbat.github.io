      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio website</h1>
        Hello and welcome to my website!
        My name is Courtney Batchelor and I am a first year student studying Creative Media Production at Massey University.
        As part of one of my papers I am creating this portfolio website.
        Here I will showcase my previous work, current work and some future projects.

      <h2>This Website</h2>
      This website was made as part of paper 289.101.
      First we learnt how to use Atom and Github.
      We then learnt useful passages of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

      <h2>ATC Website</h2>
      As part of my Digital Technology class in Year 13, I created a client-driven website.
      We had to find our own clients, of which I sought out Mr Beveridge from Oamaru's Air Training Corps.
      Together we made a website to promote the Squadron.

      <h2>Digital Fabrication</h2>
      In this paper I have been able to produce 8 items using a laser cutter and 3D printer.
      I made a jewelry box using the laser cutter and several bracelets using the 3D printer.
      I documented my progress on my own Wordpress blog.

      <h2>Animation Paper</h2>
      This project involved using Maya to animate a squirrel using animation principles.
      I also had to create other objects in the scene and add textures.
