      <h1>This Website</h1>
      This website was made as part of paper 289.101.
      First we learnt how to use Atom and Github. We then learnt useful passages of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

      <h2>Website Process</h2>
      I started by considering the colour scheme. I initially had too much pink so decided to change it.
      <div class="website_images">
        <img src="img/pink.png" id="pink" alt="pink colour scheme" title="Pink colour scheme" />
      </div>
      After settling on a colour scheme I started adding content to the home page.
      I then began adding images and text to the other pages.
      While undergoing this process I ensured that the pages had a responsive layout.
      This meant that the website would continue to function properly no matter what screen size it was being displayed on.

        <img src="img/responsive_layout.png" alt="responsive layout" title="Responsive layout" />
